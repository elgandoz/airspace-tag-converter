# Airspace Tag Converter

This is a simple tool to convert a waypoint file into airspace with cylinders of a given class and radius.

It is aimed for paragliding/hangliding tag-based competition, where the you need to tag a waypoint with a certain radius,
such as the [Turnpoint Challenge](https://www.turnpointchallenge.com/)

It is written with few lines of vanilla HTML and Javascript, mostly generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

Accept a simple [SeeYou .cup](http://download.naviter.com/docs/CUP-file-format-description.pdf) file as input and output a [WinPilot OpenAir .txt](http://www.winpilot.com/UsersGuide/UserAirspace.asp) file.
